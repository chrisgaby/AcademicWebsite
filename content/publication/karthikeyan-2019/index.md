abstract: "Modeling crude-oil biodegradation in sediments remains a challenge due in part to the lack of appropriate model organisms. Here we report the metagenome-guided isolation of a novel organism that represents a phylogenetically narrow (>97% 16S rRNA gene identity) group of previously uncharacterized, crude-oil degraders. Analysis of available sequence data showed that these organisms are highly abundant in oiled sediments of coastal marine ecosystems across the world, often comprising ̃30% of the total community, and virtually absent in pristine sediments or seawater. The isolate genome encodes functional nitrogen fixation and hydrocarbon degradation genes together with putative genes for biosurfactant production that apparently facilitate growth in the typically nitrogen-limited, oiled environment. Comparisons to available genomes revealed that this isolate represents a novel genus within the Gammaproteobacteria, for which we propose the provisional name “Candidatus Macondimonas diazotrophica” gen. nov., sp. nov. “Ca. M. diazotrophica” appears to play a key ecological role in the response to oil spills around the globe and could be a promising model organism for studying ecophysiological responses to oil spills."
