## Introduction

In a previous blogpost, I explored [prokaryotic genome size](/post/prokaryotic-genome-size/index.html). In this blogpost, I will take the previously determined genome lengths, which are reported in units of DNA base pairs, and multiply these lengths against the molecular weight of a DNA base pair to arrive at the weight of a prokaryotic genome. First, however, we will cover the fundamentals of DNA composition that are required for a basic understanding of 

## DNA Base Pairing

DNA is comprised of the nucleotide bases adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) linked by a phosphate backbone. In double stranded DNA, A and T form linkages with 2 hydrogen bonds, whereas G and C form linkages with 3 hydrogen bonds. The AT and GC base pairing is illustrated in the following molecular structure images:

The colors in the above molecular structures correspond to the CPK (Corey, Pauling, Koltun) color scheme:

<span style="color: rgb(144,144,144); font-size:20pt;">carbon is grey</span>

<span style="color: rgb(255,255,255); background-color: black; font-size:20pt;">hydrogen is white</span>

<span style="color: rgb(255,0,31); font-size:20pt;">oxygen is red</span>

<span style="color: rgb(22,88,240); font-size:20pt;">nitrogen is blue</span>

<span style="color: rgb(255,123,44); font-size:20pt;">phosphorus is orange</span>


These images of DNA base pairs were obtained online from [MolviZ.Org](http://MolviZ.Org) on the [DNA Structure page](http://biomodel.uah.es/en/model4/dna/index.htm) by Eric Martz and Angel Herr√°ez, wherein their [Nucleotide Pairing model](http://biomodel.uah.es/en/model1/dna/pares.htm) is particularly useful for illustrating the basic principles of DNA molecular composition and geometry.

## Determining the Number of Atoms of Each Element in a DNA Base Pair for Molar Mass Determination

DNA is a macromolecule consisting of multiple nucleotides. Nucleotides are comprised of a nucleoside linked to a phosphate. Nucleosides are a nitrogenous base like a purine (A or G) or a pyrimidine (T or C) linked to a sugar, which in the case of DNA is the pentose sugar deoxyribose. Hence, there are 3 subcomponents of DNA:

1. Phosphate
2. Pentose Sugar Deoxyribose
3. Nitrogenous Bases Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine

Whereas each nucleotide in DNA contains a phosphate and deoxyribose, the nitrogenous bases can vary. Indeed, it is the sequence of nitrogenous bases in the nucleotides along the length of a genome that determine the unique coding can the percentage of each nitrogenous bases vary

A summary of useful DNA facts and figures is presented in [IDT's Molecular Facts and Figures pdf](https://sfvideo.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/biotech-basics/molecular-facts-and-figures.pdf?sfvrsn=4563407_4).

### The Phosphate

### The Pentose Sugar Deoxyribose

### The Nitrogenouse Bases

I'll obtain the number of C, N, O, and H atoms in each nitrogenous base by using a column from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) files for the molecular model of each base. The PDB files for each nitrogenous base were obtained from the "required case study files" for an online [DNA case study](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/CaseStudies/) written by Leonardo Trabuco and Elizabeth Villa.


#### Adenine

I will obtain the number of atoms of each element in the Adenine strucutre by parsing its [PDB file](/files/adenine.pdb).

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Read the adenine PDB file into a tibble, skipping the first row
# that causes the column of interest to be missed.
adenine <- read_table2(file = "../../static/files/adenine.pdb", 
                       col_names = FALSE, 
                       skip = 1)

# Remove the last row that only contains "end".
A.atoms <- adenine[seq(1,(nrow(adenine)-1)),12]

# Make a table with the total number of atoms of each type.
A.table <- table(A.atoms)
A.table

```

The results corroborate with the C~5~N~5~H~5~ chemical formula for [Adenine on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine).

Next, I will calculate the total molar mass of the Adenine molecule. To do this, I will need the atomic mass of each element:


| Element | Atomic Mass      |
| --------| -----------------|
| C       | 12.0107          |
| N       | 14.0067          |
| H       | 1.00794          |

I will obtain these masses from the R package `PeriodicTable`.


```{r}
library(PeriodicTable)

# Change to a data frame.
A.df <- as.data.frame(A.table)

# Add a 3rd column that is the atomic mass of each element.
A.df2 <- cbind(A.df, MW = PeriodicTable::mass(A.df[1:nrow(A.df),1]))

# Add a 4th column that is the total molecular weight of each element
# in the nucleotide base molecule. This is the product of the atomic
# mass and the number of atoms of each element.
A.df3 <- cbind(A.df2, MW.tot = A.df2[,2] * A.df2[,3])

A.df3

sum(A.df3[,"MW.tot"])

```

Hence, the molar mass of adenine is determined to be `r sum(A.df3[,"MW.tot"])`, which corroborates with the molar mass of 135.13 g/mol listed for [Adenine on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine).

#### Thymine


#### Cytosine


#### Guanine



Hence, the cumulative weight of a pair of nucelotides in a strand of DNA is as follows (note the difference in A-T vs. G-C base pairs):



## The weight of an Average DNA Base Pair


## Genome GC Composition Variation

```{r GCHistogram, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Read the table into a tibble.
prokaryote.genomes.table <- read_csv(file = "prokaryotes.csv")

# Display the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and 1st and 3rd quartiles for the genome sizes.
summary(prokaryote.genomes.table$`GC%`)

```


A fictitious genome of average size 4.XX Mb would weight X.XXX fg if it had the highest GC content of XX.X %, whereas it would weight X.XXX fg if it had the lowest known prokaryotic GC content XX.X%, resulting in a minor difference of 0.XXX fg due to GC%.

## Conclusion

In the next blogpost, I will extrapolate from the weight of a single prokaryotic genome to the weight of prokaryotic community DNA to be expected from the typical amounts of sample material used in DNA extractions.
